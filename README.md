# FireHawk SMS Message Extractor

## Description

This is a simple command-line Python utility for extracting SMS messages from JSON files generated by the Android app **SMS Backup & Restore** by Firehawk. 

## Usage

The **src** directory contains all of my source code for this program. The Python script for extracting text can be used as shown below, with `-i` or `--input_file` being the path of the JSON file containing the SMS texts, `-o` or `--output_file` being the path of the file where the formatted texts should go, and `-s` or `--senders` being the names of each sender. 

Note that sender names cannot contain spaces or else they will be split into separate senders, i.e. `Evan Redden` will be split into two names as values are delimited by spaces. I am not sure precisely how SyncTech decides the `type` value of each message, so you may have to switch around the order of the names to get things looking correctly.

```bash
$> python ./src/extract-texts.py -i input.sms -o output.sms -s NAME_1 NAME_2
```

The output file will contain texts in the following format, in chronological order:

```
NAME (DATE): MESSAGE CONTENT.
```
